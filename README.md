# Rph's NSMB Hacking Domain theme

## Hello!
This is a custom theme I made for The New Super Mario Bros. Hacking Domain, using CSS. This theme uses a modern style and is easily customizable.
Here's a screenshot of the theme (without customization):

## Installing
To install this theme, simply go to the [releases](https://github.com/Rph-nsmb/Rph-NSMBHD-theme/releases) section and download the latest one. On your browser, you can use extesntions that allows you to use custom stylesheets, such as Stylus or CSS Injector. From there, you can import the CSS file.
_If you can't import the file, you can open it with a notepad and copy/paste its contents into the text field of the extension._
## Customizing
On the `:root` section of the files, there are several variables. You can edit them for an easy customization.

### Have a great experience on NSMBHD!
